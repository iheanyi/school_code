					    Report for Lab 5 by Iheanyi Ekechukwu

From the user's perspective, once the program is started, instructions for playing the game are given in a simple format
in a welcome message. After the welcome message is displayed, the user can begin playing the game as long as the follow
the instructions given to them in the welcome message.The program is structured to be as user friendly as possible, only
requiring the user to enter two numbers per turn and as long as the move is valid (following all the given rules of Othello),
then the user should not have any problems playing the game. Internally, the program is composed of seven different functions,
each of which do the following: print the starting pieces, print the board after a move is made, check if a move is valid,
decide which player's turn it is, flip pieces based on the move made, and determine who won the game after the game
is over. I verified that the output of the program is correct by playing multiple games and differing the BOARD_SIZE variable
and changing the winner/loser. From the games that I played, the program seemed to work correctly and no errors were found.
