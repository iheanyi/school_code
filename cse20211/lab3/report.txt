					Report for Lab 3

The final part of the assignment is a simple rolling wheel demonstration. Although basic,
the user can modify the speed of the wheel by clicking the left mouse button and slow down
the wheel by using the right mouse button. The wheel will go no further than the wall and 
it will bounce back if it does collide with the wall. In order to show the rotational motion,
the spokes within the wheel rotate when the velocity is not equal to zero. The program does
work as seen by running the program and there is no other method of verifying that the
program works other than by running the program and watching how it performs.
