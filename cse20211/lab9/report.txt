					  Report for Lab 9 by Iheanyi Ekechukwu

In this project, we built a travel agent program to help a user plan out their flights in an easy manner.
In this program, the user has to just enter their starting airport code, SBN, DEN, ATL, DTW, etc., and then
choose a valid flight from the list of flights presented to them. All of the information is laid out to the user
and printed to an external text file by the name of "itinerary.txt". After each flight choice, the user is
prompted to make sure that they want to keep the flight they just made or cancel, or ending the planning and 
just printing out the itinerary. From the programming perspective, the user's choice in flights is stored into
an array named itinerary. When printing the information, the program grabs the information from a structure
named "flight" and outputs this into the "itinerary.txt" file. The program's functions makes the code easy to read
and understand, thus allowing any outside eyes to check the program easily. I verified the output of the program
is correct by testing it myself and checking how the data is outputted to the final text document. Also,
I tested all functions to make sure that the program works as it should.
