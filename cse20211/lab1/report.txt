In terms of using Program 3 created by myself, individuals can use
it to calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate. By searching for more
information on Basal Metabolic Rate through Google, there exists a 
chart that maps out how much activity one has to do to burn the most
calories while working out and this can assist with others that are
trying to cut back on their weight. The program is structured towards
men, though later versions may make it possible for women to 
calculate their Basal Metabolic Rate as well. I made the program as 
user friendly as possible, and it asks for the input in an orderly
fashion. In terms of correctness, the program makes sure that no
negative numbers or zero  can be entered for calculation reasons.
It produces correct results, the only case where it produces 
incorrect resulsts is when a string is entered in place of a number.
The program is not programmed to correctly examine strings and there
is no method (to my knowledge) on how to prevent character input
in the program.
