					Lab 2 Report by Iheanyi Ekechukwu

From the user's perspective, the program simply works by running the designated program and it graphs
the pre-defined function for the user to see. The program can be modified internally to graph other
functions if needed, which any programmer can modify internally. I verified the output of this program 
to be correct by comparing the graph of my function to the graph displayed on a graphing calculator
 and they were similar figures, although different scales and different methods of display made the 
results differ in slight but obvious ways.
