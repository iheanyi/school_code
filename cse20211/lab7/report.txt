						  Report for Lab 7
From the user's perspective, this program works relatively simply. By using the predefined UNIX command with the syntax of
"./life < scene#.life", the user can change the scene of the program, with each scene corresponding to something different.
Scene 1 consists of still life objects, Scene 2 oscillating objects (blinking objects, Scene 3 consist of moving objects
(which eventually either die down, become still, or oscillators), Scene 4 consists of an explosion of activity before 
stabilizing into still life, and Scene 5 consists of a hectic display of activity that takes a long time to die down.
Internally, the program works by applying the rules of life by the basic use of functions. There is a function to add life,
a function to remove life, a function to count the number of live neighbors any given space has,a function to switch the data
between the current world state and the next generation and a function to apply the rules of life to the next generation.
Depending on which letter the user inputs to the first statement, the program either quits, adds life, removes life, moves to
the next generation, or plays the game indefinitely. I verified the output of the program was correct by observing the output
and the rules of life were applied correctly regardless of the inputs to the program.
