Distance traveled by the Notre Dame Football team in the Fall: 14312 miles

The user uses the program by simplying running the program. The user can make a text file
that has cities in the first row and in the first column, then the corresponding distances
should be placed into the matrix relative to the column and row Cities. After which,
the user modifies the code to incorporate the file by creating a new object, then can
either run planTrip() to manually input the cities or FootballTravel() on the object to 
calculate the total distance traveled to all cities, returning to the home city (which
should be placed last in the file). Both planTrip() and FootballTravel() call roadTrip
after they have filled the Choices matrix (which contains all the locations that will be
traveled to) and roadTrip returns the integer sum of the distances traveled between the
locations. 

roadTrip uses the choices stored in the Choices vector to calculate distances by setting
an initial sum equal to zero and incrementing this sum with the coordinates of the
Choices vector of i and i+1 in the DistanceVector. So the DistanceVector calls Choices[i]
and Choices[i+1], adding the distance at this location to the sum until it reaches the 
second to last element, after which it stops and returns the total sum.

The program was verified as running correctly by manually calculating each and every
total distance by hand and comparing the end result to that which the program produces
and in every tested case, the numbers matched together.
