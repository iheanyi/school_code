				    Report for Lab 7 by Iheanyi Ekechukwu


The elapsed time for my program to run was 60.32 seconds.

Internally, the program works by using three nested for loops for three letter words, comparing
each iteration to the surrounding letters and skipping over using "continue" if there are three
letters in a row. The logic is the same for the seven letter words, only using seven nested for loops
as well as having more cases into the if statement, comparing every three letters before the next 
iteration. 

I verified the program worked correctly by comparing my permutations to the ones that Professor Emrich
posted on the website, which matched up with one another.
