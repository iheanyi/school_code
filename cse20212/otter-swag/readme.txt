ENVIRONMENTS:
	Otter Swag was built in the Linux Red Hat Environment, it should in
	theory be able to run on any machine which has the SDL libraries
	installed, but all environments could not be tested. We have tested
	both locally on Red Hat and on the Macintosh through SSH with X11 
	forwarding, with great success. Performance on other platforms 
	cannot be guaranteed.
