			      Report for Lab 1 by Iheanyi Ekechukwu


With this program, I did not get t ofinish the rest of the program. So far, the program does not
display the board correctly and it also does not work in filling the columns up. I did not have the
chance to program a winner either, therefore the output of the program is not correct. Using a get
function for the maxDiscs ensures that it is constant therefore it will not mess up. Deconstructors
are needed because then the program will not seg fault due to the memory overload.
