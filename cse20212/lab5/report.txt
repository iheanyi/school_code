				  Report for Lab 5 by Iheanyi Ekechuwku

Within the program Buttercup, the end user does not have to do anything but input
the number of suitors. After doing so, the program will loop through the circular
list, counting every three elements and then deleting them from the list until
there is only one spot left open for Wesley to stand on. As of 1:20 PM on Friday,
the Buttercup program stopped working and I am still trying to debug what the 
problem could be, so I cannot verify that the output is correct.

In terms of data hiding, we hid the deque that was used in the Buttercup structure
and basically used the STL to our advantage due to the functions that are prseent
within the STL itself, making it easy to dynamically remove elements from the 
container rather than having to worry about an array and deleting elements that
way. Using an STL container provides multiple advantages over using an array,
simply due to the feasibility of the functions that are present within the STL
container itself.
