					  Report for Lab 2

Once again, I did not finish the lab for this week. I have found myself struggling with the labs, even when I go to the
office hours for help, but I am working on them faster nowadays. Anyways, in this lab, we mainly worked on overloading
the various functions in the Rational calculator and the Connect 4 lab, which makes it eaier for static memory management. 
I do not understand the benefits of overloading completely yet, and plus I still have to finish this lab later on in the future
Hopefully it becomes clearer in the future and sorry for being unable to complete the assignment.
